The third project in the "Web Developer" journey at OpenClassroom. The goal is to integrate and add dynamic features to a web page using CSS animations with the Sass preprocessor.

<h2> Objectives</h2>
Develop a website featuring the menus of four renowned Parisian restaurants.
Enable online reservations and menu composition.
Deliverables
Pages to integrate based on the mockups:

<h3> Homepage </h3>
Menu Pages (x4)
Button Animations
On hover, the background color of the main buttons should slightly lighten, and the drop shadow should become more pronounced. In the future, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For this purpose, a heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the mockup. On click, it should fill gradually. For this initial version, the effect can appear on hover instead of click.

<h3>Homepage</h3>
When the application has more menus, a "loading spinner" will be necessary. In this mockup, we'd like to have a preview. It should appear for 1 to 3 seconds when arriving on the homepage, covering the entire screen, and using CSS animations (no libraries). The design of this loader is not defined; any proposal is welcome as long as it aligns with the site's visual identity.

<h3>Menu Pages</h3>
Upon arriving on the page, the dishes should appear progressively with a slight time delay. They can either appear one by one or in groups (Starter, Main Course, Dessert). An example of the expected effect is provided. Visitors can add the dishes they want to order by clicking on them. This action reveals a small checkmark to the right of the dish, which should slide from right to left. For this initial version, the effect can appear on hover instead of click. If the dish name is too long, it should be truncated with ellipsis. An example of the expected effect is provided.
